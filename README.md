Decomposition of neuronal correlation structure in space and time

repo structure
```
├── data        : spike + neuron location data
├── galaxybrain : module for utils
├── notebooks   : notebooks for visualization
└── scripts     : scripts running analyses
```

requirements.txt only has two libraries, assuming you have the standard up to date scientific python installation.

## warnings
- susbets sizes should have a single source of truth, since they are used across modules and sometimes have assumed parametrizations
